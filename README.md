## GitHub Projects
### Data Analytics
1. Normalized dataset of H-2A visa work orders from 2008 to present year - available to the public, and being continuously improved. Repository here: [github.com/sieger1010/h2a](https://github.com/sieger1010/h2a/). Visualization of the data is available on [Tableau Public H-2A V2](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sieger.bokschoten/viz/H-2ALaborDataV2/WorkerTypes).


### Web Applications
1. Choropleth maps showing USDA 2017 Census of Agriculture data at a county level. Originally created to determine the best location to open an office that would reach the greatest number of agricultural workers. Nine state maps were eventually created.

     Goals for the project were to create something that didn't require any maintenance, or incur any costs that would also be easy to view for non-technical individuals, and be as intuitive as possible.

    Skills used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, D3.js, NodeJS, GeoJSON, Excel, Data Visualization, Data Analysis.
